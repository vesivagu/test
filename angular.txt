What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that offers excellent consistency. It is highly recommended,
 as it provides some syntactic sugar and makes the code base more comfortable to understand and maintain. Ultimately, 
TypeScript code compiles down to JavaScript that can run efficiently in any environment.

What are Single Page Applications (SPA)?
Single-page applications are web applications that load once with new features just being 
mere additions to the user interface. It does not load new HTML pages to display the new page's content, 
instead generated dynamically. This is made possible through JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM elements on the existing page 
itself. A SPA approach is faster, thus providing a seamless user experience. 

What are decorators in Angular? 
Decorators are a design pattern or functions that define how Angular features work. They are used to make prior modifications to a class, service, or filter. Angular supports four types of decorators, they are:

Class Decorators
Property Decorators
Method Decorators
Parameter Decorators

What are Templates in Angular?
Angular Templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attributes. In combination with the model 
and controller's information, these templates are further rendered to provide a dynamic view to the user.


What are Annotations in Angular?
Annotations in Angular are used for creating an annotation array. They are the metadata set on the class that is used to reflect the Metadata library.

What are Directives in Angular?
Directives are attributes that allow the user to write new HTML syntax specific to their applications. 
They execute whenever the Angular compiler finds them in the DOM. Angular supports three types of directives.  

Component Directives
Structural Directives
Attribute Directives 


What are filters in Angular? Name a few of them.
Filters are used to format an expression and present it to the user.
 They can be used in view templates, controllers, or services. Some inbuilt filters are as follows. 

date - Format a date to a specified format.
filter - Select a subset of items from an array.
Json - Format an object to a JSON string.
limitTo -  Limits an array/string, into a specified number of elements/characters.
lowercase - Format a string to lowercase.


Explain the lifecycle hooks in Angular
In Angular, every component has a lifecycle. Angular creates and renders these components and also destroys them before removing them from the DOM. This is achieved with the help of lifecycle hooks. Here's the list of them - 

ngOnChanges() - Responds when Angular sets/resets data-bound input properties.
ngOnInit() - Initialize the directive/component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties and sets the directive/component's input properties/
ngDoCheck() - Detect and act upon changes that Angular can't or won't detect on its own.
ngAfterContentInit() - Responds after Angular projects external content into the component's view.
ngAfterContentChecked() - Respond after Angular checks the content projected into the component.
ngAfterViewInit() - Respond after Angular initializes the component's views and child views.
ngAfterViewChecked() - Respond after Angular checks the component's views and child views.
ngOnDestroy - Cleanup just before Angular destroys the directive/component.


What is String Interpolation in Angular?
String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique that outputs the data from TypeScript code to HTML view. 
It is denoted using double curly braces. This template expression helps display the data from the component to the view. 

{{ data }}

How Bootstrap is embedded into Angular? 
Bootstrap is a powerful toolkit. It is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and building responsive web pages and web applications.

There are two ways to embed the bootstrap library into your application. 

Angular Bootstrap via CDN - Bootstrap CDN is a public Content Delivery Network. It enables you to load the CSS and JavaScript files remotely from its servers. 
Angular Bootstrap via NPM - Another way to add Bootstrap to your Angular project is to install it into your project folder by using NPM (Node Package Manager). 
npm install bootstrap 

npm install jquery

What is Lazy loading? 

Lazy loading dynamically loads the feature modules when there's a demand. 
	This makes the application faster. It is used for bigger applications where all the modules are not required at the start of the application.
