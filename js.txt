JavaScript, and many more scripting languages are used ECMAScript, among these JavaScript is a well know client-side scripting language and an implementation of ECMAScript, 
since the standard was published. The latest version is ECMAScript6.

What is strict mode?
Ans. “use strict” is not a statement but a literal expression which is supported by ECMAScript version 5. This statement instruct browser to use the strict mode, which is a safer future in JavaScript. It will eliminate some JavaScript silent errors.

Example

"use strict";
 x = 10; // this will give error
The above statement will give an error because in strict mode the variable should be declared before it is used.

The “use strict” expression can be in global scope as well as local scope

Global scope

const employee = { name: "Ram", age: 25 }
employee.name = "Raju" // it is possible 
use strict";
x = 10; // this will give error
local scope

x = 10; // This will not give error. 
myFunction();
function myFunction() {
 "use strict";
 y = 15; // This will give error
